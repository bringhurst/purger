.SH "NAME"
dstat \- Distribute file stats across nodes in a compute cluster

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdstat\fR            [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is an example for a distributed stat() using libcircle. The purpose is to
walk a large file tree which is mounted on several nodes in a cluster. Then,
as the files are stat()ed, the results are stored in a database. Using a
filesystem which benefits from heavy use of parallel reads is recommended.

Required Libraries
==================
libldap
liblber
libconfig
libpostgresql (pq)
libqt4 (for the GUI)


Directions for building:
========================
run `./configure`
run `make`             Note: support `make install` is not finished yet.
This will build of the libraries, utilities, and tests included with lanl-purger except for the GUI.

Directions for building the GUI:
================================
Note:  The GUI component is not required to use the rest of the project.
To build the GUI (you must have the Qt framework installed - http://qt.nokia.com):
cd gui
run `qmake`
run `make`
This will build the gui component called PathFinder.
